# Data Job Posting Analysis

## Overview
- This project automates the collection and analysis of job postings to streamline job searching for roles like Data Analyst and Data Scientist. By leveraging advanced AI tools and machine learning techniques, the project extracts, cleans, and analyzes data from job postings, providing insights into salary expectations, required skills, and market trends.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: Web scraping of job postings using keywords like "Data Analyst" and "Data Scientist."
- **Information Extraction**: Utilizes OpenAI API to extract additional details such as skills, salary, and remote eligibility.
- **Data Cleaning**: Removes inconsistencies in job titles, salaries, and locations using methods like FuzzyWuzzy and K-Means clustering.
- **Insights**:
  - Mid-senior and entry-level roles dominate.
  - Top locations: NYC, Bay Area, Washington, D.C.
  - Data Scientist roles offer the highest average salary ($160K/year).
  - Essential skills: Python, SQL, data visualization, and machine learning for Data Scientists.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Languages & Platforms**: Python (Anaconda, Visual Studio 2019)
- **APIs**: OpenAI API for advanced data extraction
- **Libraries**: Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn (K-Means), FuzzyWuzzy
- **Data Storage**: CSV files

## Outcomes
- Cleaned and processed 1,515 job postings into 766 unique entries.
- Identified key hiring trends, salary ranges, and skill requirements.
